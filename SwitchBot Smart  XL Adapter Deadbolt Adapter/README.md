Yes, I use a smart lock. If I didn’t use one then strangers would have to watch an entire Lock Picking Lawyer video before letting themselves in. I figured I’d save everyone the hassle and just connect it to Wi-Fi so we can all use our phones. 

With that out of the way, I am using the SwitchBot Smart Lock. Its “thumb turn adapter” seems to be compatible with just about every deadbolt except for the one I’ve got. The XL adapter does fit but it is way too big - makes for a pretty loose and weak action. If my lock wasn’t so damn stiff this wouldn’t be an issue but it is so it is. I will need to get every last bit of torque out of this device.  

The “adjustable base adapter” is also supposed to be more or less universal but, of course, it doesn’t work with my door’s lock. Luckily it looks like I can modify the base adapter to fit. 

I am going to try to 3D print an adapter to adapt SwitchBot’s XL adapter to fit the deadbolt better. I’ve been wanting to try to use my flatbed scanner to create more precise 3D models of real objects. I am going to give that a shot here. 

Here is the SwitchBot XL thumb turn adapter:

Here is a piece of tape I firmly press the shape of the deadbolt into:

Okay, scanning the SwitchBot XL adapter probably would have worked if I had calibrated its dimensions in Fusion 360. I set the scan dimensions to 8.5” x 11” and figured when I imported it into Fusion 360 as a canvas that it would be scaled according to the total dimensions of the scan. And it sort of was? it was off by anywhere from .5mm to 5mm. I ended up just using my calipers to measure it and then roughed it out in the drawing. It's printing right now so we’ll see how that goes.. 

As for the tape I used to try and transfer the deadbolts dimensions. That did not work. At first the indentation was too light to be visible in Fusion 360 so I went back and traced it with a pencil, scanned it again, and imported it to Fusion 360. Still too faint but with added inaccuracy. I probably won’t be spending any more time on this “tape indent transfer method.”
